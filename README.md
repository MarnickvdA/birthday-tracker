## Dependencies

- docker / docker-compose
- go
- goose
- sqlc

## Setup

We have some environment variables on which we depend in this project. Execute the command below and update the variables.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Most important is to have a PostgresQL server running to which we can connect. Be sure to add the connection URL as `DB_URL` in .env

```bash
# Run goose migrations on the postgres db
goose postgres $DB_URL up
```

## Running with Docker

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```
