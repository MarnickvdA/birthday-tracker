## Setup

We have some environment variables on which we depend in this project. Execute the command below and update the variables.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
go mod download
```

Most important is to have a PostgresQL server running to which we can connect. Be sure to add the connection URL as `DB_URL` in .env and .env.prod. On app startup, migrations from the `sql/schema` folder will automatically be run.
